I'm a passionate GNU+Linux and free software enthusiast who is currently a full time student at Stanford majoring in Physics. I love open source software and try to contriubte whenever and wherever I can. I reuglarly write and post articles about my projects on my [website](https://samscherf.om) and I also release everythng as GPLv3 here on my Github. I'm also the Co-Founder and CEO of a web design company called [Ampolic Digitial Solutions LLC](https://ampolic.com). I founded the company for the purpose of minimzing bloatware on the web and supporting open source princples. Checkout some of the open source projects we've developed on our company [Github](https://github.com/ampolic).
