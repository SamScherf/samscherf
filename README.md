I'm a passionate GNU+Linux and free software enthusiast who is currently a full time student at Stanford majoring in Physics. I love open source software and try to contribute whenever and wherever I can. I regularly write and post articles about my projects on my [website](https://samscherf.om) and I also release everything as GPLv3 here on my Github. I'm also the Co-Founder and CEO of [Ampolic Digital Solutions LLC](https://ampolic.com). Ampolic is a web design company founded in 2020 with the purpose of minimizing bloatware on the web and supporting open source principles. Checkout some of the open source projects we've developed on our company [Github](https://github.com/ampolic).
